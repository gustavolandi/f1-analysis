## Running Race Results Example

### Using notebook runscripts
1. Open the notebook runscripts.ipynb
2. Execute the command
```bash
%run race_results.py year=2024 weekend='Brazil' session='R' export_excel='True' excel_file_name='results_race_excel'
```
The following parameters are necessary:
   - year;
   - weekend;
   - session:
      
      - 'R' for Races
      - 'Q' for Qualifying
      - 'S' for Sprint
      - 'SQ' for Sprint Qualifying

If you desire to export in excel or csv, you can use the following parameters:
   For excel:
      export_excel='True'
      excel_file_name='WRITE_YOUR_DESIRED_FILE_NAME'
   For csv:
      export_csv='True'
      csv_file_name='WRITE_YOUR_DESIRED_FILE_NAME' 

In the example, the script is getting data from 2024 SÃ£o Paulo Grand Prix and saving a file named results_race_excel.xlsx. And it's going to plot the data in the following image:
